This program includes sorting algorithms for insertion sort, bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort, and radix sort.
All of these algorithms are split into their own methods that are called when needed. A print function is also
used to save code rather than making for loops to print the list over and over again. 
I used random integers from 1 to 1,000,000 for all of my test cases. Just adjust the size of the array to whatever
you need and it will work just fine with any size. To isolate each algorithm and prove that it's actually working
you may need to comment out the rest of the algorithms because they all use the same list. The method that I used
to get the run time of each algorithm is at the bottom. All of my results are in the pdf attached to 
this folder. It includes both the table and the graph.
